#Hangman-Game

This game is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. It is implemented in C++ with the use of vectors from the standard library (as to avoid any manual memory management issues). Currently, there is only a human vs. human mode supported, but the Artificial Intelligence is coming soon!
